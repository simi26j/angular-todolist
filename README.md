# angular-todolist
This is my todolist written in Angular

@ the current state of the app, the following points from the requirements are missing:
- number of done/pending tasks displayed under the list (needs a new component)
- navigating toiit the task details using routing (routing is not yet implemented correctly)
- the about module is added and confiugured to be lazy loaded, but the routing configuration is still buggy and this feature cannot be verified
